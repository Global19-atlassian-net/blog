Updates on Project Privacy Levels
=================================

In order to simplify our platform,
we are dropping privacy levels for projects in Read the Docs (community version).
This was source of confusion between been able to hide your documentation,
and hide the dashboard of your project,
project privacy levels were meant for the later.

This change will take effect on **May 31st, 2021**.
Note that **only the dashboard of your projects will be public**
(e.g. https://readthedocs.org/projects/docs/),
**their documentation has always been public** (e.g. https://docs.readthedocs.io/).

.. note::

   This change is only for the community version of Read the Docs (https://readthedocs.org).
   Privacy levels for `projects <https://docs.readthedocs.io/page/commercial/privacy-level.html>`__
   and `versions <https://docs.readthedocs.io/page/versions.html#privacy-levels>`__
   in Read the Docs for Business (https://readthedocs.com) always will be available.

How do I know if my project is private?
---------------------------------------

.. TODO: show the privacy level of projects in the dashboard

Additionally, in the following weeks we'll be contacting users that have private projects.

What do I need to do with my private projects?
----------------------------------------------

If you think there is private information in the dashboard of your project (like the builds page or its description),
you can delete the project in order to keep that information out of the public.
Otherwise, you don't have to do anything.

If you are looking to hide your public versions,
check out `hidden versions <https://docs.readthedocs.io/page/versions.html#version-states>`__.
If you need to host private projects,
please use `Read the Docs for Business <https://readthedocs.com>`__.
